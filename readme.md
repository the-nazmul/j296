# How foreign actors evade scrutiny while lobbying U.S. govt
## By Nazmul Ahasan

### Story Summary

Over the last decade, lobbyists employed by foreign entities spent over a hundred million dollars lobbying various levels of the United States government under a lobbying act riddled with loopholes, a review of lobbying disclosures submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives shows.

These lobbying maneuvers were regulated under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), which significantly curtailed the potency of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), the law originally designed to regulate lobbying linked to foreign countries. 

Under current legal requirements, a lobbyist — even if working for a foreign client — can avoid a higher level of scrutiny and disclosure requirements under FARA if they disclose limited information under LDA, as long as their client was not any foreign government or political party.

The analysis of data gleaned from lobbying databases maintained by the Senate and the House of Representatives suggests that foreign entities and domestic entities are not interested in the same type of issues.

For the U.S.-based entities, the health issues and budget-related issues have been the top two priorities. In contrast, foreign entities lobbied to influence taxation and trade-related issues in the U.S. the most.

Among foreign entities, those based in 15 countries identified as top ‘tax heaven’ by the advocacy group Tax Justice Network were mainly interested in taxation in the U.S, the analysis shows.

##### Sheet Used: *lda_client-foreign* tab of the *lda_client-foreign* 
**Data Analysis Process:*
- Created a pivot table using *Entity Country* as row and (unique) *client IDs* as values.
- Copied the resultant table and pasted it in a new tab. Sorted to find the highest value.
