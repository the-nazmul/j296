# Data-Driven Pitch: How Foreign Entities Lobby US Government Beyond FARA
## By Nazmul Ahasan

### Story Summary

Over the last decade, lobbyists employed by foreign entities spent over a hundred million dollars lobbying various levels of the United States government under a lobbying act riddled with loopholes, a review of official data shows.

These lobbying maneuvers were regulated under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which significantly curtailed the potency of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Under current settings, FARA only regulates lobbying that may benefit foreign political parties and governments, while the LDA covers remaining lobbying conducted on behalf of foreign entities (such as commercial foreign entities).

The analysis of a separate dataset gleaned from a database maintained by the House of Representatives suggests entities based outside the U.S. differed significantly from domestic entities in terms of areas of interest. 

For the U.S.-based entities, the health issues and budget-related issues have been the number one priority. In contrast, foreign entities lobbied to influence taxation and foreign trade-related issues the most.

Among foreign entities, those based in 15 countries identified as ‘tax heaven’ by the advocacy group Tax Justice Network were mainly interested in taxation in the U.S. Their interest in influencing U.S. taxation issues has been so disproportionate that trade — not taxation — is the number one priority for remaining foreign entities.

The examination of entities based in those 15 tax haven countries also reveals that they lobbied seriously on U.S. health issues. In total, lobbyists working on behalf of those entities filed 415 disclosures — 9.5% of the total — where they acknowledged having lobbied on health issues.

Influencing American foreign relations also appears to be a key priority for entities outside the United States: While ‘foreign relations’ was the 26th priority for domestic entities, for foreign entities it was 12th.
